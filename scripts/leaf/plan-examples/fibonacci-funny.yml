instructions: |
  You are Codex collaborating with Claude. Write a fibonacci function or method
  in the most creative, humorous, or unconventional style possible while still
  being functionally correct. Consider:

  - Funny variable names
  - Over-engineered solutions
  - Unusual programming paradigms
  - Witty comments
  - Creative output formatting

  Choose an appropriate language based on the project context. If unclear, use
  Python. Include tests to verify correctness.

  This is a simple debug task to verify the leaf do workflow is functioning.
